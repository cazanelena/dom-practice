## First task
### Exercise: Interactive Information Display

Imagine you are tasked with building a simple web component that displays a list of books and allows users to filter the books based on their genres. You will be provided with a list of books in a JSON format. Your goal is to create a web page that loads the list of books, displays them, and enables users to filter books by genre.

### Requirements:

Create an HTML structure for the page, including a section to display the list of books and a dropdown menu for genre filtering.

Style the page using CSS to make it visually appealing.

Load the list of books from a provided JSON file using JavaScript.

Display the list of books on the page, showing book title, author, and genre.

Populate the dropdown menu with unique genres found in the book list.

Implement the functionality to filter the displayed books based on the selected genre from the dropdown menu. When a genre is selected, only the books matching that genre should be shown.
